# Pokémon Info - Capstone Project Part 3

This is the prototype for the Pokémon Info web application, created as part of the Capstone Project - Part 3.

## Steps Taken

1.  **Branching:** Created a new branch named `part-3` from the `part-2` branch.
2.  **HTML Structure:** Developed the HTML structure (`index.html`) for the three pages, using semantic elements and referring to the mockup from Part 2. Added navigation with tabs to access different sections.
3.  **CSS Styling:** Created an external CSS file (`style.css`) to style the HTML elements, incorporating a visually appealing gradient background, modern font (`Roboto`), and responsive design. Improved the visual appeal and font sizes for a more professional look.
4.  **JavaScript Functionality:** Implemented JavaScript code (`script.js`) to handle the search functionality, hover effect for Pokémon icons, and trending Pokémon logic based on search count.
5.  **Content Population:** Filled in the Pokémon details for 10 Pokémon characters and replaced the placeholder images.
6.  **Testing:** Tested the prototype on different browsers and devices to ensure responsiveness and functionality.

## Resources Used

*   None (other than the provided mockup and instructions)

## Challenges Faced

*   **Implementing the Search, Hover, and Trending Functionality:** Implementing these features required careful JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation to ensure accurate tracking of search counts and dynamic updates to the page.

## Future Improvements

*   **Additional Pages:** Add more pages for other Pokémon or features.
*   **Enhanced Search:** Improve the search with features like filtering, sorting, and displaying multiple results.
*   **Dynamic Data:** Fetch Pokémon data from an API instead of hardcoding it.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Add more interactive elements like animations or transitions.
*   **Persistent Trending Data:** Use local storage to persist trending data across sessions.
